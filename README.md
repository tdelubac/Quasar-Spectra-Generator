# Quasar Spectra Generator 

The Quasar Spectra Generator (QSG) is a software intended to generates quasar spectra. Given a set of quasar spectra, it performs a principal component analysis (PCA) to decompose the original set, and is then able to generate random quasar templates from the principal components. It is made of two principal pieces of code: 

1. QSG_fit.py that performs the PCA 
2. QSG.py that generates spectra given a model obtained by QSG_fit.py

The code comes with a precomputed model based on SDSS-III BOSS DR12 data able to generate quasar spectra per bin of 0.1 in redshift.
